## Abstract
The general idea of this small model is to have an Arduino board that contains a motion sensor and a servo motor. At each movement detected by the sensor the servo motor reacts according to the programmed parameters and after a certain time it will return to the initial state. You can also move the remote servo motor using a mobile application via Bluetooth.
